hello world repository assignment
hello my name is **Hope** and I am a college student
I like to read and listen to **music** 
I also like to lift weights and *exercise* 
I went to *college* for **Culinary arts** but now I am going back for IT 
Things I like to cook are: 
1. pasta
2. cakes, cookies, and pies
3. baleadas *(a national dish from Honduras, where my husband is from)* **(They are handmade flour tortillas typically eaten with beans, eggs, avocado, sour cream, cheese, and sometimes meats)**
One of my *favorite* cuisines is Thai, it's delicious and full of flavor
**I also love Chinese and Vietnamese food**
